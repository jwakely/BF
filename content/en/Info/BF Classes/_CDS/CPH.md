			<td>   Missing Code </td>

	<tr>
			<td>Specification Defect Bug</td>
	<td>A specification (algorithm, protocol) of an operation an error or a rule (policy, keying material) used by the operation has an error, which when implemented becomes the bug causing the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. It must be fixed to fix the bug and to resolve the vulnerability.</td>
