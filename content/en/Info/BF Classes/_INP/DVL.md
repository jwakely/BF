	<tr>
			<td>Validate </td>
	<td>Check data syntax (proper form/grammar) in order to accept (and possibly sanitize) or reject it (incl. check for missing symbols/elements).</td>

			<td>Sanitize </td>

			<td><strong>Causes</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Code Defect Bug</td>
	<td>The operation has a bug, which is the first cause for the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. The bug must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Missing Code </td>
	<td>The entire operation implementation or a part of its specification is absent.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Erroneous Code </td>
	<td>The operation implementation has a bug.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Specification Defect Bug</td>
	<td>A specification (algorithm, protocol) of an operation an error or a rule (policy, keying material) used by the operation has an error, which when implemented becomes the bug causing the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. It must be fixed to fix the bug and to resolve the vulnerability.</td>

			<td>   Corrupted Policy Data </td>
	<td>Unintentionally modified policy data (the values the policy checks for) due to a previous weakness.</td>

			<td>   File Injection </td>
	<td>Maliciously inserted data (e.g., with .. and / or with file entries) into an input used to access/modify files or as a file content.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Safelist </td>
	<td>A policy based on a set of known good content.</td>

	<td>A policy based on syntax format (e.g., defined via regular expression).</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Length </td>
	<td>A policy based on allowed number of characters in data. Note that this is not about the data value as size of an object.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>Source Code </td>
	<td>Shows where the buggy/faulty operation code is in the program -- in what kind of software.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Codebase </td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Third-Party </td>
	<td>The operation is in a third-party software.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Standard Library </td>
	<td>The operation is in the standard library for a particular programming language.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Compiler/Interpreter </td>
	<td>The operation is in the language processor that allows execution or creates executables (compiler, assembler, interpreter).</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Bare-Metal </td>
