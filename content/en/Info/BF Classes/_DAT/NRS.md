			<td>Refer </td>
	<td>Use a name in local or remote scopes of source code. The Type System resolves the name and binds a data type to it.</td>

			<td>Call </td>
	<td>Invoke a function implementation. The Type System binds a function implementation to the resolved function name. A polymorphic function implementation is first resolved and then bound.</td>

	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>

			<td>Code Defect Bug</td>

	<tr>
			<td>Specification Defect Bug</td>
	<td>A specification (algorithm, protocol) of an operation an error or a rule (policy, keying material) used by the operation has an error, which when implemented becomes the bug causing the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. It must be fixed to fix the bug and to resolve the vulnerability.</td>
