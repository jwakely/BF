	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>            Primitive </td>
	<td>A scalar data type that mimics the hardware units - e.g., int (long, short, signed), float, double, string, Boolean. A primitive data type is only language defined and is not built from other data types.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>            Structure </td>
	<td>A composite data type - e.g., array, list, map, class. A structured data type is built from other data types and has primitive or structured members.</td>
