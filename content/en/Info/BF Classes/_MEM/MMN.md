			<td>Allocate </td>
	<td>Reserve space in memory for an object; defines its initial boundaries and size.</td>

			<td>Data </td>
	<td>The data value of an object -- stored in object's memory.</td>

			<td>Address </td>

			<td><strong>Causes</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Code Defect Bug</td>
	<td>The operation has a bug, which is the first cause for the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. The bug must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Missing Code </td>
	<td>The entire operation implementation or a part of its specification is absent.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Mismatched Operation </td>

			<td>Data Fault</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Hardcoded Address </td>

			<td>   Single Owned Address </td>
	<td>Exactly one pointer owns the object.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Wrong Size </td>

			<td>Address Fault</td>
	<td>The object address in use is wrong.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Memory Leak </td>
