# BF Vulnerability Model <br/>_`Irena Bojanova, PI and Lead, Bugs Framework (BF)`_

A high level version of the BF software security vulnerability model is presented on Figure 1. Following the [BF definitions](/BF/info/vulnerability-model/bf-concepts/) of bug, fault, error, and weakness, a software security vulnerability is modeled as a cuasal chain of underlying weaknesses that leads to a security failure. A security bug causes the first weakness, leading to an error. This error becomes the cause (i.e., the fault) for a next weakness and propagates through subsequent weaknesses until a final error is reached, causing the security failure.

Each weakness is an instance of a weakness type with a particular bug or fault as a cause and an error as a consequence. The error establishes a transition to another weakness or a failure.

A bug always causes the first weakness in a chain of weaknesses (*Note: Focus of this work are weaknesses within software.); it is a coding or specification defect, which, if fixed, will resolve the vulnerability. A fault causes each intermediate state. The last weakness always ends with a final error (undefined or exploitable system behavior) that causes the failure (a violation of a system security requirement).

A transition is the result of the operation over the operands. For example, in Figure 1, Operation 1 from the first weakness has a Bug and results in Error 1, which becomes the fault for operation 2, leading to Error 2. The chain goes on, until the last operation results in a Final Error, leading to a failure.

Therefore, a vulnerability can be described precisely as a chain of weaknesses and their transitions. This chain is a sequence of improper states in the vulnerable software. 

Each improper state is an instance of a weakness type, corresponding to a BF class. The transition from the initial state is by improper operation (an operation that has a bug) over proper operands. The transitions from intermediate states are by proper operations with at least one improper operand (the operand is at fault).

In some cases, several vulnerabilities must be present for an exploit to be harmful. The final errors resulting from different chains converge to cause a failure (see  Figure 2). The bug in at least one of the chains must be fixed to avoid that failure.

The model of a formal BF specification of a software security vulnerability with N underlying weaknesses is presented on Figure 1. 

 The Bug is an improper opration. A fault is an improper operand. The Operation Defect Type can be Code or Specification. The Operand Fault Type can be Data, Name, Type, Address, or Size. Name is in reference to a resolved or bound object, function, data type, or namespace. The others are in reference to an object.
