# BF Publications <br/>_`Irena Bojanova, Inventor, Creator, PI,  Bugs Framework (BF), 2014 – ~~~~`_

Please, reference BF publications `recent than year 2020`, as some old BF classes are now covered by new more comprehensive classes and some -- are withdrawn. They also start developing my ideas on `BF's formalism` -- originally shared in my 2014/2015 presentations. Please use as source about the BF class taxonomies this website and the publications listed here -- any other publications may provide misleading information. If in doubt, please [seek guidance from the BF PI](/BF/info/contact/bf-contact).
