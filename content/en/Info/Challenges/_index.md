# BF Challenges <br/>_`Irena Bojanova, PI and Lead, Bugs Framework (BF)`_

The [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/) repository has 228 000 software vulnerability entrees (as of August 2023) and 25K+ are being added each year. Systematic labeling of this huge set of CVEs benefits greatly the advances in modern artificial intelligence (AI) Cybersecurity research. The [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/), with input from the security community, labels CVEs with [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) entries. However, this has proven to be difficult as CWE has imprecise descriptions, gaps and overlaps in covarage.
